      <p>In the time of COVID-19 I am very thankful the entire Google team was able to move to a virtual remote format and to uphold summer 2020 internships despite the current pressing struggles of this transition.
        <br> 
        <br>My first week of onboarding virtually consisted of the usual drinking from a firehose and inhaling extreme amounts of info that usually happens when joining a company.  For me, I have never worked before and I began learning a lot of legal, financial, employee benefits, and company lingo terminology. Throughout the first few days, I immediately encountered the difficulty of being able to sit down and do computer work for a full eight hour day and week days. I acquired a stand up attachment for my desk and have been enjoying dancing while coding.
        <br>        
        <br>The onboarding tasks I completed quickly gave me a sense of Googleâ€™s company culture and operation style. The copyright and privacy info sessions were overwhelming with all the different types of guidelines and rules around what I can use or release. However, the technical trainings actually calmed my nerves because they consisted of material I have learned from my two years so far at Georgia Tech. This showed me that what I am learning is used in the working-world and that I have the fundamentals to not be entirely thrown off like I thought I would be. Through these, I enhanced my fundamental skills in the way that Google uses them. Ultimately, I became excited learning that my code will go into th eGoogle codebase for years and that I have the responsibility of quality assurance and code health of my code.
        <br> 
        <br>Throughout my first two weeks I always wrote down questions that popped into mind to properly direct them to either a virtual support engineer (VSE), peer interns, or hosts. This included writing a long list of the general career and company questions for the one-on-one sessions I have with my hosts Annie Lin and Chris Prichard.
        <br> 
        <br>I enjoyed attending intern social hangouts and being active in my STEP cohort, gWIC, and interest group chats like the basketball chat meeting others with similar interests.
        <br> 
        <br>Week two surrounded developing a web portfolio with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Some things I learned through this process by asking VSEs is that HTML and CSS are markup languages (not Turing complete languages) and thus are not source code that need copyright statements like JavaScript files do. I also came to understand how to use the JavaScript console (chrome developer tools console) and the console.log() function to handle errors. I also learned what the .bashrc file is and added a command to it to always set up Bash in Java 8.
